// NTHUOJ 12241 - Restaurants in Hsinchu   
// Description
// After some hard work of finding his queen, Knuckles finally arrived NTHU!
// Knuckles is exhausted. He wants to grab some delicious food. However, as all of us know......
// THERE IS NO "DELICIOUS" FOOD IN HSINCHU.
// (Actually there are some restaurants that are not bad. But just "not bad"...)
// This truth, which is cruel, hits Knuckles pretty hard. Knuckles doesn't give up and start his journey of finding delicious food in Hsinchu. 
// However, the more he goes out and seeks, the truth is just getting more clear...
// The i-th time that those bad-taste restaurants Knuckles found is Fi . Knuckles found that F1 = 1, F2 = 1, and Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2 .
// The more Knuckles goes out, the more bad-taste restaurants he found.
// He is tired of finding more and more bad restaurants. He just wants to know there are how many bad restaurants when he goes out for the i-th time.

// There's a sequence F.
// F1 = 1, F2 = 1, Fi = Fi-1 + Fi-2.
// Find out Fi .
